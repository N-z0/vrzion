**The Py versioning**


## 🚩 Intro
Defines the correct version numbers of python files.  


## 📋 Glossary
 - *Semantic versioning* (aka *SemVer*)  
	Is a widely-adopted version scheme that uses a three-part version numbers: *Major.Minor.Patch*


## ℹ️ Description
Python files should have a version code composited by 3 numbers as defined by the *Semantic versioning* scheme.
 - Changes Breaking the compatibility with the previous version are indicated by increasing the *major number*.
 - New features increment the *minor number*.
 - And all others non-breaking fixes increment the *patch number*.

This program evaluates the version code that matches the python files.  
And then the version code is printed or written in the python files.  


## 📝 Note
 - The submitted python files must have a **\__version__** variable.
 - The *major number* is incremented if the Python file import new modules,remove functions/classes/methods or have their parameters changed  
 - The *minor number* is incremented if the Python file add functions/classes/methods/parameters or remove some modules  
	It leads to software destruction and may damage your device.
 - The *patch number* is incremented if the content of the Python file has changed but its functionalities are still the same.
